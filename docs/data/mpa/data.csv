1,7.1.1,1,MX,MPA,ENV,diversity,type6,Fish species richness increased signficantly from a mean of 15 to 25 species in the MPA with the largest proportion of no-take zone (35% in Cabo Pulmo National Park).
2,7.1.2,-1,MX,MPA,ENV,diversity,type6,Fish species richness declined in MPAs with a lower proportion of no-take zones (0-16% no-take zone).
3,7.1.3,0,MX,MPA,ENV,biomass,type6,Fish biomass increased between 12-15% depending on trophic level in the MPA with the greatest propotion of no-take zone of (35%). Total biomass increased from 0.75 - 4.24 t ha-1 (463%) and predator biomass increased by 1070%.
4,7.1.4,0,MX,MPA,ENV,biomass,type6,"Fish biomass did not change signficantly in two categories of MPA (0-16% no-take zone). MPAs with smaller no-take zones had a small non-significant recovery and accessible areas had a small, non-significant decline in quality."
5,7.1.5,1,MX,MPA,ENV,diversity,type6,The diversity of predator fish increased significantly in the MPA with the greatest propotion of no-take zone of (35%).
6,7.1.6,0,MX,MPA,ENV,diversity,type6,The diversity of predator fish decreased or remained the same in other MPAs with lower proportions (0-16%) of no-take zone.
7,7.10.1,1,SP,MPA,ENV,biomass,type6,There was signficantly higher biomass of edible spiny lobsters (Palinurus elephas) in MPAs than unprotected areas during the advanced stage when the reserve was 21-25 years old.
8,7.10.2,1,SP,MPA,ENV,density,type6,There was a signficantly higher density of edible spiny lobsters (Palinurus elephas) inside MPAs than unprotected areas during the advanced stage when the reserve was 21-25 years old. Density ratios ranged from 0.03 to 0.13.
9,7.10.3,1,SP,MPA,ENV,abundance,type7,"In the absence of fishing mortality, old and large edible spiny lobsters (Palinurus elephas) accumulate within the MPA."
10,7.10.4,1,SP,MPA,ENV,reproductivesuccess,type7,"Relative reproductive potential of females increased in the MPA but in fished areas relative reproductive potential remained roughly stable. During the advanced MPA period, egg production per unit area in the fished areas ranged from 2%–4% of that in the MPA."
11,7.11.1,-1,ID,MPA,SOC,compliancewithlawsandregulations,type7,Illegal activities continue including fertilizer bombing (for coral) and potassium cyanide poisoning (poaching Napolean wrase for live fish trade).
12,7.11.2,-1,ID,MPA,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Community attitudes toward endangered and restricted species were generally positive, providing no net economic loss. Locals are unhappy that they are prohibited from catching Napolean wrasse, certain shells and giant clams. Despite their support in principle for conservation resources, interviewees expressed disapproval of the current and future restrictions that the creation of the park had brought, with an overall negative attitude towards the park and its management. Most people felt that the park would not have any direct benefits for them."
13,7.11.3,-1,ID,MPA,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"The majority of people living in a village (90%) close to a MPA stated that they were not well informed about the MPA and did not understand its purpose because they had never been formally informed by park rangers or officials. Of the 133 people interviewed in 1998 after the Management Plan was officially mandated, nearly 80% were not able to identify the locations or purpose of the zones in the park. Almost all commented that they did not understand how the park was to be managed. There was widespread disapproval and confusion about the new rules and regulations, and people indicated that they felt that these restrictions made their lives increasingly difficult."
14,7.12.1,1,BR,MPA,ECON,harvestablespecies,type6,Biomass of target fish was lower inside what would become the MPA than the furthest sampling site outside the reserve area before the establishment of the MPA. After 5 years biomass had increased both inside and outside fisheries.
15,7.12.2,0,BR,MPA,ENV,biomass,type6,Biomass of non-target species did not change signficantly over time.
16,7.13.1,0,MX,MPA,SOC,compliancewithlawsandregulations,type7,"Immediately after a no-take policy was declared there was a decline in recreational fishing activity in the marine reserve by between 10.05 and 19.41%. However, by 2008 activity levels had returned to levels seen before no-take was implemented. Authors posit that intially fines were issued and boats impounded but enforcement of reserve was not consistent or prolonged so fishing returned to the reserve."
17,7.14.1,1,IT,MPA,ENV,density,type6,The density and size of sea bream was higher inside MPA than outside as a result of no-take for ~10 years.
18,7.15.1,0,TZ,MPA,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,The results show that Village Fishermen Committees were participating in the implementation of the MPA but not in its planning phase. Participation was mainly in the form of manipulative and passive participation. Other local actors did not participate at all.
19,7.15.2,-1,TZ,MPA,SOC,conflict,type7,"Conflict exists between stakeholders and between local communities. The government assumed that justice was achieved by distributing equipment, alternative income generating projects, and relying on tourism for local development. However, the distributed equipment and tourism development have created conflict and injustice within and between villages."
20,7.15.3,-1,TZ,MPA,SOC,conflict,type7,The government monopolized power in the MPA decision-making which led to protests.
21,7.15.4,-1,TZ,MPA,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,Authors conclude that education and poverty are barriers to participating in MPA decision making. Some fishermen perceived themselves as constrained in participating in MPA decision-making and activities because of poverty as they lacked the ability to express themselves and could not afford the time investment.
22,7.15.5,-1,TZ,MPA,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Tourism related to the MPA created problems such as inequality between livelihoods, environmental destruction and local power asymmetries between hotel management and local people."
23,7.15.6,1,TZ,MPA,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,Fishermen perceived that they benefitted from the government created special-use zone even though they knew that the benefits would be greater if the area was better enforced.
24,7.15.7,-1,TZ,MPA,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,Sharing and allocation of revenue generated by charging a fee to tourists to enter the park has been a non-transparent process.

38,7.19.1,1,AS,MPA,ECON,harvestablespecies,type6,83% (48/58) of juvenile coral trout and 55% (41/74) stripey snapper juveniles were collected from reefs that were open to fishing. 7% of coral trout and 22% of stripey snapper were retained in natal reserves. The six no-take reserves represent ~28% of reef but supply ~50% of recruitment.
39,7.2.1,1,PP,MPA,ECON,harvestablespecies,type6,"Within the community tenure area containing the fish spawning aggregation (FSA), 17%–25% of juveniles were produced by the aggregation. In four adjacent tenure areas, 6%–17% of juveniles were from the aggregation. The proportion of juveniles originating from the FSA declined with distance from the community tenure area containing the FSA. 50% of juveniles were within 14km of the orginiating FSA. Therefore, the MPA is potenitally able to replenish stocks within relatively short distances."
40,7.20.1,-1,UK,MPA,ENV,areaandrepresentativeness,type7,"85.2% of habitat types were poorly represented, and therefore results show that existing reserves are inefficient at protecting a representative and sustainable sample of marine habitats in Wales."
41,7.21.1,-1,HO,MPA,SOC,accesstoresources,type7,"Less commercially valuable species were frequently a form of social currency on both the island and mainland. The management plan’s “blindness” to many of the ways in which marine non-commerical resources can be valuable resulted in a number of restrictions, such as bans on turtle hunting and the spatial exclusion zones, which have ultimately proven to be some of the principal sources of tension between residents and the reserve managers."

64,7.27.7,1,BF,MPA,ENV,coralhealth,type6,"Reduced fishing pressure and weak predator-prey interactions within marine reserves can create trophic cascades and reduce the coverage of macro-algae on coral reefs. Increased fish grazing, primarily driven by reduced fishing, was strongly negatively correlated with macroalgal cover and resulted in a 2-fold increase in the density of coral recruits within a Bahamian reef system. The sites with the greatest grazing pressure and lowest macroalgal cover and highest coral recruitment density were the three sites surveyed inside MPAs."
65,7.28.1,1,CH,MPA,ECON,economicvulnerability,type7,"As the tourism industry related to the MPA develops, more fishermen find jobs in tourism and other sectors, and the number of full-time fishers in the MPA is in decline. 75% of the residents in a traditional fishing village near the MPA now make a living without fishing whereas all of its over 2000 residents were once dependent on fishing."

97,7.37.1,-1,RP,MPA,ENV,areaandrepresentativeness,type7,"As of 2008 at least 985 MPAs had been established in the Philippines, and they covered approximately 14,943 km2. Of these, 942 MPAs had a no-take component, with a combined no-take area of 1459 km2. Thus, 4.9% of coastal municipal waters (within 15 km of the coastline) were protected within MPAs, with 0.5% within no-take areas. Accounting for this potential range, the authors estimated that between 2.7% and 3.4% of coral reef area in the Philippines is protected within no-take MPAs. The Philipines therefore have not attained the set target of 15% coverage of coastal municipal waters within no-take MPAs nor the 10% coverage of coral reef area."
