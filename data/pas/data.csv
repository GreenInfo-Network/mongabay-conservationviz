1,2.1.1,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"Deforestation decreased on average in PES areas by 50%, but the deforestation rates in this area without PES were on average low (0.8%/year). Leakage decreased effectiveness by about 4%, overall additionality was about 46% (deforestation reduced from 2.4% in 3 years to 1.17% in 3 years, i.e. by 1.2 percentage points). Effects were heterogeneous in terms of high and low poverty areas and geographic location within Mexico."
2,2.10.1,0,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Poor recognition of women as resource managers, difficulties in involving the poorest smallholders in the project and a progressive deficit in the level of knowledge transfer concerning forests, climate change and carbon trading. However, payments have contributed to increase individual and collective welfare"
3,2.11.1,1,MX,PES,ENV,carbonstockemissions,type7,"Between 29076 and 34000 tCO2eq were sequestered over 5 years per project, and 51850 – 67584 tCO2eq over 15 years. Perceived possible increase in water and air quality, greater commitment to control forest fires and illegal activities. Mostly forest restoration, complete reforestation was less successful. These are only preliminary results."
4,2.11.2,0,MX,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"46.9% of interviewees considered income from PES to be important, the other half did not. There were some issues with inequality. The perceived benefits also differed between communities. Communities received between 38.73% to 77.67% of total investment. These are only preliminary results."
5,2.12.1,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"The annual deforestation rate was 6.75%, and majority occurred in control ejidos (non-participants). Additional 12-14.7% of forest area that was enrolled in PES has been not deforested as a result of PES during 8 years of the program."
6,2.13.1,1,EC,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Presented as equitable, with strong emphasis on reaching the poorest. This is achieved by relating incentives to the size of the set aside area (the first ha pays the most). Even though only owners with a formal land title can participate, there has been legal assistance to achieve formal ownership and many participants sign up exactly for this reason."
7,2.14.1,0,CS,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,There was no major impact on land tenure security - the land-reform effects on land tenure security predate the initiative.
8,2.14.10,0,EC,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,There was no change in land tenure security; activities preceding the initiative helped secure individual land titles.
9,2.14.11,1,CS,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,Participation in the project increases land tenure security against land invasions.
10,2.14.12,1,CS,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type7,The participants perceived reduced soil erosion and protection of water sources.
11,2.14.2,-1,EC,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"Farmers' association was weakened, but this probably already started happening prior to the scheme's introduction."
12,2.14.3,1,CS,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,The PES scheme encouraged the creation and strengthening of community associations
13,2.14.4,-1,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,There was a deterioration in road quality due to their increased use for forestry and wood-processing industry.
14,2.14.5,1,CS,PES,SOC,accesstoland,type7,Recovery of forest landscape in the region has improved soils and has provided a side benefit of promoting tourism
15,2.14.6,1,EC,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,The plantation that was part of the PES  project helped to secure land tenure.
16,2.14.7,0,EC,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Communities mention few impacts, but the initiative has helped establish a community credit system."
17,2.14.8,1,EC,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,Community fund was created and this has helped with a purchase of a tractor and land for a school
18,2.14.9,0,EC,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"One of five communities saw a reduction in water quality, there was a general increase in game supply, and plantations served as important windbreaks."
19,2.15.1,0,RW,PES,ENV,illegalhuntingloggingmining,type6,"There was a decrease in human activity after the PES implementation for most units of study (both those where PES was implemented and control), but results between PES and non-PES are not significantly different. Authors consider the observed pattern to be generally supportive of PES effectiveness for conservation since they suspect that the reduction observed in control cells is in part because of their hope that project will be expanded into their cells in the future."
20,2.15.2,1,RW,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type6,The vast majority of interviewees thought that the project was fair (all households receiving the same payment).
21,2.15.3,0,RW,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type6,"Household wealth seemed to be the same across control and treatment cells, only the very poorest perceived to be negatively impacted (those dependent on bamboo)."
22,2.15.4,0,RW,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type6,"A minority of interviewees perceived the project as unfair and negatively impacting their livelihoods. This group of people were Bamboo collectors and basket makers who lived the closest to the park. Of this minority, 50% of respondents considered it unfair."
23,2.16.1,-1,CH,PES,ENV,treediversity,type1,The limited evidence there is on biodiversity shows that planting non-native trees and monocultures might have negative impacts on biodiversity.
24,2.16.10,1,CH,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type1,"Two studies had evidence on water retention, and they both found increased water retention, up to 56% in the dry season. This would likely lead to a decline in flooding."
25,2.16.11,1,CH,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type1,"Forestland certificates have been issued to the majority of owners in studied areas, but there has been some variability."
26,2.16.12,0,CH,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type1,"Several studies found that inequality was initially reduced by the scheme, but later was unable to cope with the increased inequality due to rapid development of off-farm jobs. But initially, there was a significant reduction in the Gini coefficient and increase in income mobility."
27,2.16.2,0,CH,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type1,"Some households have been negatively impacted due to local reductions of grain productivity, but at the county and national level, grain production increased."
28,2.16.3,1,CH,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type1,"The majority of households reported that they received full compensation (77-95%); or were satisfied (75-98% in one study) with the payment. The majority of households in most studies reported improvements in life quality, a minority reported a decline in life quality."
29,2.16.4,-1,CH,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type1,"In the pilot region (Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan) households were negatively impacted by the shortages in delivery of compensation subsidies in the initial years of the project."
30,2.16.5,0,CH,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type1,"The majority of cases that were able to obtain the amounts of payments reported that less money was distributed than the amount prescribed, but most studies did not report the actual amount, only the policy standard (300RMB/ha)."
31,2.16.6,0,CH,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type1,"There was a variation in the opinion of farmers whether payments covered opportunity costs. In some provinces, farmers were largely satisfied, in others, some were satisfied and some incurred economic losses. In some areas opportunity costs were lower than payments."
32,2.16.7,1,CH,PES,ENV,carbonstockemissions,type1,"An average of 132.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalent were sequestered by cropland conversion, and more if barren land conversion was included. Generally, a minority of farmers planned to reconvert their land to agriculture if subsidies ended. About 80% of households reported tree survival rate above 70%."
33,2.16.8,1,CH,PES,ENV,reforestation,type1,The estimated increase in forest cover nationally was higher in PES counties by 5.6% than in non-PES counties. There is however a lot of variation between regions and counties.
34,2.16.9,1,CH,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type1,"Several studies within the meta-analysis found reduction in soil erosion (38.8% over 10 years in one region), and increased nutrient retention. No study reported negative or no change."
35,2.17.1,-1,CO,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"Only 13% stated that they were required to conserve forest on their land as a part of the program, which shows a sever lack of understanding. We decided to assign a negative value to outcomes of less than 33%."
36,2.18.1,1,MZ,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type4,"There was a significant positive effect on the amount of cash and spending in participating households, which indicates that the PES program increased participating households' income."
37,2.18.2,0,MZ,PES,ENV,illegalhuntingloggingmining,type4,There was a slight (but not significant) decrease in the use of forest resources for subsistence by households.
38,2.18.3,-1,MZ,PES,SOC,accesstoland,type4,"There was a decline in the yield of crops early in the project. This is likely because of tree planting along field boundaries, mixed row crops, etc. This decline was significant in two out of the four matching methods used (but always negative)."
39,2.18.4,0,MZ,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type4,"It was clear that male-headed and richer households were favoured by the project when compared to female-headed and poorer households, even though participation was open to everyone."
40,2.19.1,0,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"There was a 2.6% reduction in deforestation, when using a spatially explicit counterfactual model (result reversed if using simple comparison). This reduction was not significantly different from 0. 198ha would have been deforested without the initiative."
41,2.19.2,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"There was a 11.6% decrease in forest degradation, when using a spatially explicit counterfactual model (result reversed if using simple comparisons). 700 ha would have been degraded without the initiative. This difference was significantly different."
42,2.2.1,1,CS,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,Forest cover on participating farms increased by 11-17% of the mean contracted area in PES farms over 8 years. This increase in additional; control matched farms lost forest cover.
43,2.20.1,-1,CH,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type6,"In monoculture plantations, there were modest losses of bird diversity. The vast majority of China's new forests are monoculture plantations."
44,2.20.2,-1,CH,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type6,There were major losses in bee diversity in monoculture and mixed plantations. The vast majority of China's new forests are monoculture plantations.
45,2.20.3,1,CH,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type6,"In mixed plantations, there were modest gains in bird diversity. Only a small proportion of China's new forests are mixed plantations."
46,2.21.1,1,UG,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"In villages where PES was implemented, tree cover declined by 2-5% in 2 years (4.2% average), which is less than the 7-10% decline in control villages (9.1% average). There was no detectable leakage."
47,2.21.2,0,UG,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type4,There was no appreciable effect on participants' consumption or other measures of economic well-being.
48,2.22.1,1,MZ,PES,ENV,reforestation,type7,"Over 5 years more than 500000 trees were planted by farmers, expecting to sequester 82056 tCO2."
49,2.23.1,1,KE,PES,ENV,reforestation,type6,Auction and performance driven PES was more successful than reforestation contracted by Kenyan Forestry Service. Seedling survival was on average 15% higher. Authors note that this approach might be difficult to scale up.
50,2.23.2,1,KE,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type6,Poor households accounted for the majority of project participating households and they were not excluded by external reasons from participating. Authors note that this approach might be difficult to scale up.
51,2.24.1,1,HO,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type7,Majority of users perceived that water quality and availability had improved during the past two years (79% and 64% of respondents).

60,2.25.1,0,EC,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,43% stated that their family received benefits from the PES scheme. We have decided to assign neutral outcome to values between 33-66%.
61,2.25.2,0,EC,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,"53% perceived communal benefits (school equipment, scholarships, water tanks). We have decided to assign neutral outcome to values between 33-66%."
62,2.25.3,0,EC,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"The majority of respondents said their perceived level of information about the Socio Bosque project was “a little” (over 50%), over 20% said they knew “nothing” and less than 20% said they knew “a lot”."
63,2.25.4,0,EC,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"The majority of respondents said their perceived level of participation in the decision making about the Socio Bosque project was “a little” (close to 60%), almost 20% said they knew “nothing” or “a lot”."
64,2.26.1,1,ID,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type7,"20% reduction in sediment concentration was achieved. The reward was gradated according to the amount of reduction in sediment concentration achieved, 30% was the highest goal. This is only a preliminary finding."
65,2.27.1,1,CS,PES,ENV,reforestation,type7,"During the project, 27000 ha were reforested (3000 ha/year)."
66,2.27.10,1,CS,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,"There was a small positive impact on legalization of land tenure. The majority of participating land owners already did have a legal title before the program, but those that did not were able to obtain legal titles through the program."
67,2.27.11,1,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,"There was an overall positive impact on the relationship between landowners and national organizations. Landowners felt that they had a possibility to request and receive support from local and national organizations. However, they also felt that in the long run, there might be more conflict due to land restrictions."
68,2.27.2,1,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,"There was a highly positive impact on strengthening forestry institutions, especially regarding NGOs and law enforcement, and to a lesser extent public organizations."
69,2.27.3,1,CS,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"There was a strong increase in awareness of ecosystem services and goods, and sustainable practices were adopted. Land owners stated that they would continue with the new practices even without payments."
70,2.27.4,-1,CS,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Poorer households were at a disadvantage, because investment beyond payments were required. i.e. both in the short and long run, the program was not profitable for the poorer. The gap between poor and rich widened."
71,2.27.5,0,CS,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Overall, the impact of PES on income was neutral, but this was because whereas short-term income was affected negatively, medium and long-term income was affected positively for the upper class and negatively for the working and poor classes. Large farms benefited and small farms lost out."
72,2.27.6,0,CS,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Overall, there was no significant difference in households' economic risk, because multiple individual criteria showed opposing results: whereas farmers were satisfied with the regularity of payments, the payments did not create a security asset (for example it did not become easier to take loans)."
73,2.27.7,1,CS,PES,SOC,jobs,type7,"There was a positive impact on job creation within the reforestation sector (transport, processing). Work conditions did not improve. Most people perceived reforestation to be better for job creation than livestock breeding."
74,2.27.8,-1,CS,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,"The program did induce land concentration, which is considered a negative impact by authors (i.e. richer land owners buying more land for reforestation). The impact of the resulting land concentration on conflict and migration was not signification."
75,2.27.9,0,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,"The majority of landowners did not perceive a significant change in infrastructure at a regional level, as reforestation was a minor activity compared to agriculture."
76,2.28.1,0,TZ,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,No changes can be demonstrated in forest cover and forest disturbance during the initial pilot period of the project.
77,2.28.2,1,TZ,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Income of farmers improved, and they were able to invest into roofs and seeds, school fees, etc."
78,2.28.3,0,TZ,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,Poorer households are not able to participate much because they have less land available to enrol into the project.
79,2.29.1,-1,BR,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type7,"Respondents perceived the payments to be too low to cover opportunity costs, stating that swidden agriculture can bring a much higher profit. The monthly allowance from the project accounted on average for 11.9% of income, whereas manioc agriculture, the main driver of deforestation, accounted for 21.1% of income on average."
80,2.3.1,0,CS,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type4,"There was no significant difference in household assets between PES and non-PES households between 1996 and 2005. Despite this, participants re-enrolled, and semi-structured interviews suggest that participation was motivated by securing land tenure rights and contributing to the public good of forest conservation."
81,2.3.2,0,CS,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type4,"There was no significant difference in quality of life between PES participating and non-participating households. Despite this, participants re-enrolled, and semi-structured interviews suggest that participation was motivated by securing land tenure rights and contributing to the public good of forest conservation."
82,2.30.1,1,CS,PES,ENV,carbonstockemissions,type7,"Overall, the PES program in Costa Rica sequestered about 1 million tC between 1998 and 2005 through establishing plantations."
83,2.30.2,1,CS,PES,ENV,carbonstockemissions,type7,"Using a model of avoided deforestation, the national PES program in Costa Rica is estimated to have prevented the emission of 11 million tC between 1999 and 2005. However, is it difficult to assign this impact exclusively to the program."
84,2.31.1,1,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"In the whole community overall, Gini coefficient (measure of income inequality) decreased after PES implementation. This is due to the higher importance of PES in lower-income households compared to higher income households."
85,2.31.2,-1,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,PES payments increased the inequality between (but not within) ejidatarios (land owners) and pobladores (landless) by 2 percentage points.
86,2.31.3,-1,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type7,"87% of people thought the amount of payment was insufficient to meet their expectations. The amount of the payment (28USD/ha) was lower than net coffee income (577USD/ha) and net palm income (430USD/ha). However, return to effort was considerably higher for PES than for other activities."
87,2.31.4,0,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"Those ejidatarios who own mature forest stated that conservation efforts would continue even without payments, indicating low additionality. However, the poorer segments of the population indicated that they would deforest without incentive."
88,2.31.5,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,All interviewees plan to keep conserving the forest.
89,2.32.1,0,CS,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"Between 1997 and 2000, this nationwide study found that the clearing rate on all unpaid lands suggests that 0.2% of the enrolled locations would have been cleared without payment, or about 1% in a typical 5 year contract. The main explanation is the already low national deforestation rate."
90,2.33.1,0,"CS,CH,MX,MZ",PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type1,"In general, it is more difficult for poor households to participate and therefore the contribution of PES to poverty alleviation appears to be low. However, the authors emphasize the poor evidence base."
91,2.33.2,1,"CS,CH,MX,MZ",PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type1,"The included PES programs have on average reduced deforestation rate by 0.21 percentage points and they have reduced forest cover change (which includes both forest loss and gain) by between 0.5 and 1.6 percentage points. This is interpreted by the study as low, however, both numbers were significantly different from zero, therefore here we include the result as positive."
92,2.34.1,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"Whereas overall, the municipality lost forest cover, this loss was lower on PES properties than on non-PES properties. The deforestation rates on PES properties was lower by 34.8 percentage points for pine-oak forests and 18.3 percentage points for cloud forests. 29% of participants interviewed said they would not cut their forest in absence of PES, 29% said they would have converted their land to agriculture, 36% would have kept their land as forest through forestry and conservation."
93,2.34.2,0,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type6,"The majority of participants interviewed stated they would re-enroll their land into the program, even though the payments accounted for less than 3% of their income, suggesting the forgone revenue from the land was equally low, and opportunity costs were likely met (but not exceeded)."
94,2.34.3,0,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type6,The majority of interviewed participants and non-participants stated that the programme has not improved the economic well-being of participants.
95,2.34.4,0,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type6,The majority of respondents did not think that the programme has improved trust between citizens and government and that there was not a positive social impact on people outside the programme.
96,2.35.1,0,CS,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"There was no significant difference between the forest use in non-PES and PES farms. PES did appear to speed up agricultural land abandonment, which would likely happen even without PES, but slower. However, it is not guaranteed that abandoned land will become forest."
97,2.36.1,0,VM,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Only 14% of payments were actually disbursed to the households, and less than 10% of the eligible households received payments. Problems due to unclear land tenure. The rest of the results from this study are future projections and not included here."
98,2.36.2,0,VM,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"The PES schemes was set up in a way that the poorest households, which were also the most dependent on forest resources, were unable to participate. The rest of the results from this study are future projections and not included here."
99,2.37.1,1,CH,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type6,"The habitat suitability index for Giant panda increased 2.5 times more in areas that were monitored by participating households, compared to areas patrolled by the government (other variables were controlled for)."
100,2.38.1,1,EC,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"Deforestation has stopped, and native vegetation cover has increased. Previous occasional timber sales have stopped. However, this coincided with a nationally reduced pressure on forests due to lower profitability of cattle ranching."
101,2.38.2,1,EC,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Not formally assessed, but most participating households are the poorest, and the income from PES seems to exceed opportunity costs (but these are only rough estimates), and accounts for about 31% of household expenditure."
102,2.38.3,0,EC,PES,ENV,reforestation,type7,"22287 ha of forest planted, which is less than originally planned, but accounts for about half of all Ecuadorian reforestation. In some ecosystems where reforestation happened on volcanic soil, net carbon sequestration is low or even negative, due to initial planting of pine trees. Later, the project experimented with native species. Net carbon sequestration remains controversial."
103,2.38.4,1,EC,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Even though minimum land area that can be enrolled increased due to large set-up costs for small areas, PROFAFOR took measures to include poor land holders, by aggregate community groups being able to participate. The NPV of participating households was positive."
104,2.4.1,-1,BL,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Some sections of the local communities became financially poorer, at least in the short-term. This analysis does not take opportunity costs into account."
105,2.4.2,1,BL,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Despite employment and resource losses and gains, overall, the communities had higher direct gains (358380USD) than direct losses (229800USD). This analysis did not take opportunity costs into account."
106,2.5.1,0,BL,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"All participants apart from one complied with the program rules (i.e. maintained forest cover). The likely conservation effect is negligible, as farmers are enrolling parcels that they would not have cut anyway. Main benefit is land tenure establishment. However, there has been a likely positive impact in terms of reduction in land clearing by landless people. There is little data on whether higher cloud forest cover actually leads to better hydrology downstream, however, study is under way."
107,2.5.2,1,BL,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"There has been a likely positive conservation effect through reduced forest degradation from cattle grazing, a threat that was assessed as medium prior to the project."
108,2.5.3,0,BL,PES,ENV,illegalhuntingloggingmining,type7,"The conservation effect in terms of reducing timber extraction and hunting has been negligible, because even though this was reduced, it was low even before the project."
109,2.5.4,0,BL,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"The participation in the PES project is not equitable. The landless (who are usually the poorest) are unable to participate. However, some landless people are employed through PES."
110,2.5.5,0,BL,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"The impact on livelihood is very variable, since the payments are in kind (beehive) and the returns to beekeeping have been extremely skill-dependent. The net present values of beehive transfers range between –US$15.25/ha/year (negative value) and +US$12.66/ha/year (positive value)."
111,2.6.1,1,BR,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type6,Forest cover loss has declined about 12% faster in PES implementing areas than in non-PES areas (there was a decline everywhere). This amounts to an additional prevention of 1481 ha of forest between 2008 and 2011. Projected future deforestation varies broadly according to the model used and these are only preliminary results.
112,2.6.2,1,BR,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"About half of people felt better off than before the project was implemented, and the majority of these indicated that it was due to external support (i.e. the PES project). 14% of respondents felt worse off and the remainder about the same. These are only preliminary results."
113,2.6.3,1,BR,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,There were slightly but significantly fewer illegal invasions by external actors after project implementation.
114,2.6.4,1,BR,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type7,"For most households, the foregone income would be far below the annual cash allowance from the PES project, according to the interviews. This only reflects results of a model, which was parametrized through interviews."
115,2.7.1,0,MA,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Participation of households in the project is not equitable. Households that are most at risk from cyclones (reliant on growing rice on slopes, called tavy) cannot participate in the project because they do not own permanent rice plots. Such households are also most likely to be negatively impacted by conservation measures."
116,2.8.1,1,CB,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type7,"There have been substantial increases in species populations (e.g. Ibis). Local people have begun to enforce the land-use plan regulations to protect habitats, for example by refusing to accept in-migrants and controlling where new forest is cleared. Full understanding will require a counterfactual comparison after several years."
117,2.8.2,1,CB,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Around 40% of families were involved to some extent in the project and were benefiting financially from it. Donations to village fund helped pay for new school, road, fish ponds, wells and repairing waterpumps."
118,2.8.3,1,CB,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,Yearly increase of tourism by about 36% since 2005. Revenue has increased by about 100%/year due to improved service quality.
119,2.8.4,0,CB,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type7,The effect of the program in protecting species is not yet clear.
120,2.8.5,1,CB,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Villagers selling rice through the program were initially offered 200% price premium, which caused even the worst buyers to rise prices, but villagers still preferred selling rice under the PES scheme."
121,2.8.6,1,CB,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Substantial income was gained by many families through the project, contributing significantly to their yearly income."
122,2.8.7,1,CB,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type7,"There was a substantial increase in threatened bird species nest numbers; reduction in nest poaching, and a continuous increase in the number of bird nests monitored by the PES project participants."
123,2.9.1,0,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,The project did not improve equity in terms of access to project by rich and poor people. Only richer households were able to dedicate land to tree planting.
124,2.9.10,0,BH,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,The project did not improve equity in decision making. Communities were marginalized in project design.
125,2.9.2,0,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"The project did not improve equity in terms of access to project by different genders. Men were prioritized in decision making, and decisions favoured men (e.g. which type of tree would be planted)."
126,2.9.3,0,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type7,"Payments just about met opportunity costs but not establishment and maintenance costs. Moreover, opportunity costs were only covered for farmers developing plantations in open pine forests."
127,2.9.4,0,GT,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,The project did not improve equity in terms of access to project by rich and poor people. Agreements were reached without accounting for marginalised neighbouring communities.
128,2.9.5,0,GT,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,Local communities were not included from the beginning and were mostly unaware of environmental benefits. Conflicts existed even before project began. There was a limited participation of service providers in decision making.
129,2.9.6,-1,NU,PES,ECON,opportunitycosts,type7,The PES covers only a fraction of income (26USD compared to 147USD that can be made of year ha/year); i.e. does not come close to covering the opportunity costs. The compensation only accounts for <10% of providers' total income.
130,2.9.7,1,NU,PES,SOC,conflict,type7,There was no apparent conflict with service providers. Users' sense of control over water quota allocation has increased.
131,2.9.8,0,NU,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"There was a limited participation of potential providers, due to insufficient communication and involvement in project planning. 68% of interviewees were unaware of PES, 78% stated that they were never consulted."
132,2.9.9,1,BH,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,The PES enabled purchase of new land added to the existing protected area. Carbon payments covered 4% of NGO costs and 9% of protection costs.
