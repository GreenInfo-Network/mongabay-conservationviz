1,2.1.1,1,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type4,"Deforestation decreased on average in PES areas by 50%, but in areas where the overall deforestation rate was low. Additionality was achieved only in low-poverty areas, leakage was high in poor areas, sometimes even leading to overall increase in deforestation. Negative leakage in richer areas. Program more effective in southern and northeastern states of Mexico."
2,2.10.1,1,KE,PES,ENV,reforestation,type6,Auction and performance driven PES was more successful than reforestation contracted by Kenyan Forestry Service. Seedling survival was on average 15% higher.
3,2.10.2,1,KE,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type6,Poor households accounted for the majority of participating households and they were not excluded by external reasons from participating.
4,2.11.1,-1,BL,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,Some sections of the local communities became financially poorer.
5,2.11.2,1,BL,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Despite employment and resource losses and gains, overall, the communities have gained. (e.g. jobs from timber industry lost, new jobs in carbon gained)"
6,2.12.1,1,CB,PES,ENV,animaldiversity,type7,"Substantial increases in species populations. Local people have begun to enforce the land-use plan regulations to protect habitats, for example by refusing to accept in-migrants and controlling where new forest is cleared. But authors suggest that understanding if this program is effective at delivering conservation will require a counterfactual comparison once it have been in operation for several years"
7,2.12.2,1,CB,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Equitable - Significant payments are made only to a minority of families since the number of tourism employees is limited. It is perceived to be fair by the majority of participants, despite apparent inequalities since communal benefits derived, such as a new school, building a road and fish ponds are ranked highly"
8,2.12.3,1,CB,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,Yearly increase of tourist numbers by about 36% since 2005

10,2.12.5,1,CB,PES,ECON,opportunitycost,type7,"Villagers selling rice through the program were initially offered 200% price premium, which caused even the worst buyers to rise prices, but villagers still preferred selling rice under the PES scheme."
11,2.12.6,1,CB,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Equitable – payments are approximately proportional to the size of land holdings, meaning that wealthier individuals with larger fields will benefit the most. It is perceived to be fair by the majority of participants, despite apparent inequalities since communal benefits derived are ranked highly"

18,2.15.1,1,BL,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type7,"All participants apart from one complied with the program rules (i.e. maintained forest cover). There is little data on whether higher cloud forest cover actually leads to better hydrology downstream, however, study is under way.  Low additionality, if any, as farmers are enrolling parcels that they would not have cut anyway. Main benefit is land tenure establishment."

Bird survey established that avian diversity is the highest in cloud forests, which are the focus of the PES schemes. Low additionality, if any, as farmers are enrolling parcels that they would not have cut anyway. Main benefit is land tenure establishment."
20,2.15.3,0,BL,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Inequitable - The landless are unable to participate; these people are normally the poorest in the region studied. The impact on livelihood is very variable, since the payments are in kind (beehive) and the returns to beekeeping have been extremely skill-dependent. The net present values of beehive transfers range between –US$15.25/ha/year (negative value) and +US$12.66/ha/year (positive value). Some landless people are employed through PES."
21,2.16.1,0,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Poor recognition of women as resource managers, difficulties in involving the poorest smallholders in the project and a progressive deficit in the level of knowledge transfer concerning forests, climate change and carbon trading.

39,2.21.2,0,MZ,PES,ENV,illegalhuntingloggingmining,type4,There was a slight (but not significant) decrease in the use of forest resources for subsistence by households.
40,2.21.3,-1,MZ,PES,SOC,accesstoland,type4,"There was a significant decline in the yield of crops early in the project. This is likely because of tree planting along field boundaries, mixed row crops, etc."

45,2.22.11,1,CS,PES,SOC,awarenessempowermentparticipation,type7,"There was a strong increase in awareness of ecosystem services and goods, and sustainable practices were adopted. Land owners stated that they would continue with the new practices even without payments."
46,2.22.12,-1,CS,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Poorer households were at a disadvantage, because investment beyond payments were required. i.e. in the short run, the program was not profitable. The gap between poor and rich widens."
47,2.22.2,1,CS,PES,ECON,directeconomicbenefits,type7,"Even though reforestation was not profitable initially (investment beyond payments required), it payed off after several years.

48,2.22.3,0,CS,PES,SOC,communitywellbeingandlivelihoods,type7,"Overall, there was no significant difference, because multiple individual criteria showed opposing results: whereas farmers were satisfied with the regularity of payments, the payments did no contribute to a lower economic risk (for example it did not become easier to take loans)."
49,2.22.4,1,CS,PES,SOC,jobs,type7,"There was a positive impact on job creation within the reforestation sector (transport, processing). Work conditions did not improve. Most people perceived reforestation to be better for job creation than livestock breeding."
50,2.22.5,0,CS,PES,SOC,conflict,type7,"The program did induce land concentration (i.e. richer land owners buying more land for reforestation), but the impact on conflict and migration was not signification."
51,2.22.6,0,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,"The majority of landowners did not perceive a significant change in infrastructure at a regional level, as reforestation was a minor activity compared to agriculture."
52,2.22.7,1,CS,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type7,"There was a small positive impact on legalization of land tenure. The majority of participating land owners already did have a legal title before the program, but those that did not were able to obtain legal titles through the program."
53,2.22.8,-1,CS,PES,SOC,conflict,type7,"The majority of landowners saw potential sources of conflict in the long run due to the restrictions of land use under the program, and also due to the level of payments, which was perceived to be too low."
54,2.22.9,1,CS,PES,SOC,infrastructureandinstitutions,type7,There was a positive impact. Landowners felt that they had a possibility to request and receive support from local and national organizations.

60,2.26.1,1,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"In the whole community overall, Gini coefficient (measure of income inequality) decreased after PES implementation. This is due to the higher importance of PES in lower-income households compared to higher income households."
61,2.26.2,-1,MX,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,PES payments increased the inequality between ejidatarios and pobladores (landless) by 2%.
62,2.26.3,1,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycost,type7,The payments were considerably higher than the return to effort for other activities.
63,2.26.4,-1,MX,PES,ECON,opportunitycost,type7,87% of people thought the amount of payment was insufficient to compensate their expectations.
64,2.26.5,0,MX,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"Those ejidatarios who own mature forest stated that conservation efforts would continue even without payments, indicating low additionality. However, the poorer segments of the population indicated that they would deforest without incentive."
65,2.27.1,-1,CH,PES,ENV,treediversity,type1,The limited evidence there is on biodiversity shows that planting non-native trees and monocultures might have negative impacts on biodiversity.

70,2.27.6,1,CH,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type1,"Several studies within the meta-analysis found reduction in soil erosion (38.8% over 10 years in one region), and increased nutrient retention. No study reported negative or no change."
71,2.27.7,1,CH,PES,ENV,waterregulationerosionprevention,type1,"Two studies had evidence on water retention, and they both found increased water retention, up to 56% in the dry season. This would likely lead to a decline in flooding."
72,2.27.8,1,CH,PES,SOC,landgrabbingbetterlandtenure,type1,"Forestland certificates have been issued to the majority of owners, which has been associated with a differentiation effect in households access to land."
73,2.27.9,1,CH,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type1,"Several studies found that inequality was initially reduced by the scheme, but later was unable to cope with the increased inequality due to rapid development of off-farm jobs. But initially, there was a significant reduction in the Gini coefficient and increase in income mobility."
74,2.28.1,1,EC,PES,ENV,deforestationfragmentationanddegradation,type7,"Deforestation has stopped, and native vegetation cover has increased. Previous occasional timber sales have stopped. However, this coincided with a nationally reduced pressure on forests due to lower profitability of cattle ranching."
75,2.28.2,1,EC,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Not formally assessed, but most participating households are the poorest, and the income from PES seems to exceed opportunity costs (but these are only rough estimates), and accounts for about 31% of household expenditure."
76,2.28.3,1,EC,PES,ENV,reforestation,type7,"22287 ha of forest planted, which is less than originally planned, but accounts for about half of all Ecuadorian reforestation. In some ecosystems where reforestation happened on volcanic soil, net carbon sequestration is low or even negative, due to initial planting of pine trees. Later, the project experimented with native species."
77,2.28.4,1,EC,PES,SOC,equalityequitylessmarginalization,type7,"Even though minimum land area that can be enrolled increased due to large set-up costs for small areas, PROFAFOR took measures to include poor land holders, by aggregate community groups being able to participate.
